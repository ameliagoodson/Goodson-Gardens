# Learnt
New and previously familiar concepts including:
* Modal boxes/lightboxes including toggling display through pure CSS and toggling classes with JS and jQuery
* Constructing layouts in pure CSS without frontend libraries, gaining deeper understanding of grid and flex, positioning and units.
* Differences between native JS and jQuery with regards to selectors and modification of DOM elements. 
* Further learning on UI and how to make user navigation easy and intuitive
* Giving accessibility a greater importance than previous projects by:
  *   giving consideration to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
  *   testing website through the WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation) tool and refactoring code to increase compliance including unique and descriptive alt tags, colour contrast checks, more semantic HTML tags and improved heading structure.  WAVE evaluation of this website [available here:](https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://ameliagoodson.github.io/Goodson-Gardens/index.html)  
  * The main page jumbotron image was initially a carousel of five or 10 similar images intended to add visual interest but after learning that carousels are typically not compliant with accessibility standards, the idea was abandoned. There are ways of coding a carousel such that it complies with WCAG but it would include captions for each image, a slow animation and the ability to pause the animation, which didn't fit in with my visual design of the site.
